linuxrc - yast interface
========================

linuxrc communicates with yast via two files:

(1) /etc/install.inf
  This file is written before linuxrc starts yast and contains a number of
  variable settings in a 'key: value' (one per line) format.
  yast is quite picky when parsing this file and makes e.g. a difference
  between a missing key and a key set to 0.

(2) /etc/yast.inf
  This file is written by yast when it exits and tells linuxrc what it should
  do or whether there was some error.
  Entries are also in a 'key: value' format.


*** Note ***

  This document describes the settings in both file from a developer's
  perspective. At some places, I've added some additional remarks between
  dashes ('-') when something needs further clarification.

  This covers the current situation (master branch in git). In the past
  linuxrc used to put also a number of network config settings into
  install.inf, but this is no longer the case.


= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

yast.inf
--------

# char* config.new_root
# int config.restart_method
# action, linuxrc should take
# if device, it's put into config.new_root and we chroot there and start
# else, set config.restart_method: reboot = 1, halt = 2, kexec = 3
# - I think yast never puts a device here -
Root: reboot|halt|kexec|<device to start from>

# char* config.keymap
# load keymap
# if set, takes the keyboard setting from yast
# - unused by yast? -
Keytable: %s

# config.language = set_langidbyname(char*)
# set language
# if set, takes the lang setting from yast
# - unused by yast? -
Language: %s

# int config.rebootmsg
# - obsolete -
# that's really an obscue feature showing a popup asking the user to
# remove CD or floppy when the machine is about to reboot
RebootMsg: %d

# int config.aborted
# != 0 indicates to linuxrc that yast bas been (deliberately) aborted
# linuxrc then shows no error message
Aborted: %d


*** Note ***

  (1) at least 'Root' || 'Aborted' should be set

  (2) linuxrc also checks the yast exit code

  (3) Keytable and Language _can_ be set (don't know if they still are) to
  tell linuxrc the current settings. linuxrc in turn will pass them on via
  install.inf in case the user runs yast again. linuxrc itself does not care
  about the Language setting (no translations any longer).

install.inf
-----------

# if != 0, linuxrc was in manual mode
# (yes, it can be > 1)

# strictly do what's documented); I would question that yast2 working specially
# when manual mode was active [showing extra dialogs] is still justified) -

# Note2: a network interface might be up and running even if linuxrc

*** Note ***

 There may be some more entries in install.inf but they are put there by
 some inst-sys scripts and not linuxrc.
