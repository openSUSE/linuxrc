# specifying installation repositories in linuxrc

## 1. regular install media

*(repo meta data are in /suse/setup/descr/)*

linuxrc identifies this repo by checking for a file '/content' in the
installation repository. The file must have a valid signature
('/content.asc'). linuxrc parses this file for sha* digests (the `HASH` lines).
These digests are used to verify any files linuxrc accesses from the
installation repository.

To specify the installation repository, use the `install` option:

```sh
install=ftp://example.com/foo
```

linuxrc also loads a file system image containing the installation system
(`YaST`) from the repository. The default location is `boot/<ARCH>/root`.

In the example above on `x86_64` this would be `ftp://example.com/foo/boot/x86_64/root`.)

It is possible to specify a different location (e.g. in case the
installation system is not part of the repository) using the `instsys`
option. Either as a separate option or appended to the `install` url:

```sh
install=ftp://example.com/foo instsys=disk:/bar/root

# is the same as
install=ftp://example.com/foo?instsys=disk:/bar/root
```

`instsys` can be a relative url (a plain file name) which is then interpreted as relative
to the `install`-url:

```sh
install=ftp://example.com/foo instsys=bar/root

# is the same as
install=ftp://example.com/foo instsys=ftp://example.com/foo/bar/root
```

Note that even though `instsys` can point anywhere, the files downloaded
from there must still match the digests obtained from `/content` from the repository location.

Note also, that the full path as specified in `content` must appear in the
url. For example, if `content` provides a sha256 digest for `boot/x86_64/root` this will not be applied to
`foo/root`.


## 2. plain repomd repository

*(repo meta data are in /repodata/)*

linuxrc identifies this repo by checking for a file '/repodata/repomd.xml' in
the installation repository. This file's signature is not checked (linuxrc
does not parse this file).

As there's normally no installation system included in such a repository,
you'll have to pass its location using the `instsys` option. For example,
the openSUSE Tumbleweed repo has repomd data.

Normally you would use:

```sh
install=http://download.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/repo/oss
```

but you can also use repomd:

```sh
install=http://download.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/repo/oss/suse instsys=../boot/x86_64/root
```

Note that unless you specify also `insecure=1` in the latter case, you'll
get warnings about linuxrc not being able to verify the downloaded images.

Lets see how to avoid this.

### 2.1. getting file digests

There is no longer a `content` file. Instead, there is now a `CHECKSUMS`
file (with sligthly different format) containing sha256 digests of
repository files.

`CHECKSUMS` must be signed (detached signature in `CHECKSUMS.ASC`).

linuxrc gets the digests from two locations:
- a `content` file included in the initrd at installation system build time (placed directly into linuxrc's config directory)
- `CHECKSUMS` from the repo location

To include `content` in the initrd in a place linuxrc finds it, do something like:

```sh
mkdir -p /tmp/foo/etc/linuxrc.d
cp content /tmp/foo/etc/linuxrc.d/
cd /tmp/foo
find . | cpio -o -H newc | xz --check=crc32 -c >>initrd_on_boot_medium
```

## 3. components linuxrc reads

linuxrc reads files from two distinct locations:

1. the installation system ('inst-sys')
2. the installation repository ('repo')

The repo location is specified with the `install` option. Optionally, the inst-sys location is specified
with the `instsys` option. If it's not given, it is implicitly assumed to be `boot/<ARCH>/root`, relative to the
repo location.

See the previous sections for examples.

### 3.1. files read from inst-sys location

linuxrc replaces the last path component from the location url with `config`
to get the url of a config file and tries to read it.

If the config file is *not* there, linuxrc will continue to read the inst-sys image as originally specified and mount it.

If the config file was found (the normal case) it is parsed to determine the
components needed for the inst-sys and then the components are loaded.

A simple config file may look like:

```sh
# boot/x86_64/config

root:   common root bind
rescue: common rescue

```

Meaning that the `root` image consists of three files `common`, `root`, and `bind` and the `rescue` image of two parts
`common` and `rescue`. So, assuming the standard locations,
linuxrc will load `boot/<ARCH>/common`, `boot/<ARCH>/root`, and `boot/<ARCH>/bind` in the first case and
`boot/<ARCH>/common` and `boot/<ARCH>/rescue` in the second.

More general the syntax is:

```sh
part:      sub_part1 sub_part2 ...
sub_part1: sub_sub_part11 sub_sub_part12 ...
```

You can modify a part specification by:

1. prefixing it with `?` to mark it optional
2. appending `?list=path_spec1,path_spec2,...` to indicate you need not the
full image but only the files matching any of the path specs (shell glob
syntax)
3. appending `?copy=1` to indicate that this is not an image or archive to mount or unpack but a
plain file to copy to the `/` directory
4. using `<lang>` (verbatim!) as macro to be replaced by the current locale

With this in mind a more realistic config file example could look like:

```sh
root:               common root bind ?cracklib-dict-full.rpm ?yast2-trans-<lang>.rpm ?configfiles
rescue:             common rescue ?cracklib-dict-full.rpm
configfiles:        control.xml?copy=1
yast2-trans-ko.rpm: yast2-trans-ko.rpm un-fonts.rpm?list=*/UnDotum.ttf

```

Here, the inst-sys would consist of `common`, `root`, `bind`, `cracklib-dict-full.rpm` (if it exists),
`yast2-trans-en_US.rpm` (if it exists and assuming current locale is `en_US`), and additionally (if it exists),
`control.xml` is downloaded and stored as `/control.xml`.

For the Korean locale we'll need also a special font rpm (`un-fonts.rpm`) but only `UnDotum.ttf` from it.

### 3.2. files read from repo location

In addition to the files described in sections 1. and 2., linuxrc will try to read these files (and store them in `/`):

- `/media.1/info.txt`
- `/license.tar.gz`
- `/part.info`
- `/control.xml`

and, if **no** `AutoYaST` option has been given, it will read **and parse**

- `/autoinst.xml`

and then add an `AutoYaST` option pointing to the downloaded file.

Note this happens **after** downloading the files in section 3.1. and may overwrite them.
